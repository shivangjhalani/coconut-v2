    "question": "Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature? The choices are: (0) sample B, (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature, (2) sample A.",
    "steps": [
      "The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B.",
      "So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.",
      "Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."

      "The only arrow pointing from the rough-legged hawk leads to the earthworm.",
      "No arrows point from the earthworm to any other organisms.",
