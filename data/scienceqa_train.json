    "steps": [
      "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait.",

      "Yellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait.",
      "A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene.",
